/**
 * Order model class representing customer orders in the boba shop.
 * 
 * This class serves as a data model for customer orders in the POS system,
 * corresponding to the Orders table in the database schema. It encapsulates
 * all the essential information about an order including its unique identifier,
 * timestamp, customer association, employee who processed it, total cost, and
 * the week number for reporting purposes.
 * 
 * The class supports both registered customers (with customerID) and walk-in
 * customers (customerID can be null). It provides proper encapsulation through
 * getter and setter methods, implements standard Object methods for comparison
 * and string representation, and follows JavaBean conventions.
